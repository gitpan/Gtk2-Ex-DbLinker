SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    his module automates the process of tying data from a database to
    widgets on a Glade-generated form. All that is required is that you name
    your widgets the same as the fields in your data source.

    Steps for use:

    *   Create a DataManager object that contains the rows to display. Use
        DbiDataManager, RdbDataManager or DbcDataManager depending on how
        you access the database: sql commands and DBI, DBIx::Class or
        Rose::DB::Object

    *   Create a Gtk2::GladeXML object to construct the Gtk2 windows

    *   Create a Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker::Form object that links the data and the
        windows

    *   You would then typically connect the buttons to the methods below to
        handle common actions such as inserting, moving, deleting, etc.
